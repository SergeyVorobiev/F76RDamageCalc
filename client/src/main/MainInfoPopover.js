            <p className="m-1"><strong>CRIT</strong> calculates critical damage, <strong>‚ò†Ô∏è Fr:</strong> means crit frequency (1 / 2 - every second shot is crit).</p>
            <p className="m-1"><strong>SNEAK</strong> calculates sneak damage (100% hits are sneak).</p>
            <p className="m-1"><strong>HEAD</strong> calculates head shot damage, <strong>ü§ï Fr</strong> means head shot frequency (80% - 4 of 5 shots are head shots, kill time for each time can be slightly different due to randomness).</p>
            <p className="m-1"><strong>Creature.</strong> A creature can have effects, equipment or perks that can affect resistance / damage (ex. immune perks, most often from Radiation and Poison), but the calculator will show the data only from curve-tables, except for 3 main bosses where radiation is overridden by 'Infinity').</p>
            <p className="m-1"><strong>This calculator</strong> does not represent your real game experience, it has some limitations and it calculates creature's life time
                provided that a creature is standing still under the fire until death. </p>
