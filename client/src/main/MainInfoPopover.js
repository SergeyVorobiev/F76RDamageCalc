            <p className="m-1"><strong>CRIT</strong> calculates critical damage, <strong>‚ò†Ô∏è Fr:</strong> means crit frequency (1 / 2 - every second shot is crit).</p>
            <p className="m-1"><strong>SNEAK</strong> calculates sneak damage (100% hits are sneak).</p>
            <p className="m-1"><strong>HEAD</strong> calculates head shot damage, <strong>ü§ï Fr</strong> means head shot frequency (80% - 4 of 5 shots are head shots, kill time for each time can be slightly different due to randomness).</p>
            <p className="m-1"><strong>DPS</strong> (damage per second) is counting reload time also. If you have only 1 slot in a magazine, 1 shot per second, 10 damage per shot and 1 second to reload, then dps = 5 provided that resistance of a creature = 0.</p>
            <p className="m-1"><strong>Creatures.</strong> Real NPC's can have equipment or perks that can affect resistance / damage that not presented in the calculator.</p>
            <p className="m-1"><strong>This calculator</strong> does not represent your real game experience, it has some limitations and it calculates creature's life time
                provided that a creature is standing still under the fire until death. </p>
