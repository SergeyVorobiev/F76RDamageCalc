            <p className="m-1"><b>Aiming, Standing still, Night, VATS, Non-VATS</b> is considered to be enabled by default when a user applies legendary and perks which depend on these states.</p>
            <p className="m-1"><strong>CRIT</strong> calculates critical damage, <strong>‚ò†Ô∏è Fr:</strong> means crit frequency (1 / 2 - every second shot is crit).</p>
            <p className="m-1"><strong>SNEAK</strong> calculates sneak damage (100% hits are sneak).</p>
            <p className="m-1"><strong>HEAD</strong> calculates head shot damage, <strong>ü§ï Fr</strong> means head shot frequency (80% - 4 of 5 shots are head shots, kill time for each time can be slightly different due to randomness).</p>
            <p className="m-1"><strong>DPS</strong> (damage per second) includes reload time, charge time, attack delay. If you have only 1 slot in a magazine, 1 shot per second, 10 damage per shot and 1 second to reload, then dps = 5 provided that resistances of creature = 0.
            Charts show <b>DPS</b> provided that <b>Sneak</b> triggers every hit and <b>Crit</b> / <b>HeadShot</b> trigger
            as specified, accuracy and chance counting for every damage separately. For some effects like <i>First Blood</i> enemy health matters in calculating resulting DPS.</p>
            <p className="m-1"><strong>Creatures.</strong> Real NPC's can have equipment or perks which can affect resistance / damage which are not presented in the calculator.</p>
            <p className="m-1"><strong>This calculator</strong> does not represent your real game experience, it has some limitations and it calculates creature's life time
                provided that a creature is standing still under the fire until death. </p>
            <p className="m-1">However when all else being equal you can rely on this numbers to compare efficiency
                of weapons with a pretty good accuracy. Go to GitHub page via burger menu for details.</p>
